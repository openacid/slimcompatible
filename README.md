# slimcompatible
A compatibility testing utility for slim

It builds marshaled data with specified version of slim for testing if a later
version `slim` is able to load data from an old version.

# Usage

- Checkout a version such as `v0.5.4` of `slim`.
- `go run .` to use that version of `slim` to generate marshaled data.
